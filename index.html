      <h2>Life of a Seashells</h2>
      <p><img src="images/seashells.jpg" alt="seashells">Tiny creatures known as mollusks, like snails or clams, create a calcium carbonate-based protective layer to begin the life of a seashell. They live in and defend themselves from predators using this exoskeleton. The unique patterns and shapes that relish are produced as these mollusks grow because as their outer coverings expand, new layers are created. The mollusk's shell is left on the seafloor when it has finished its life cycle. The shells are eventually washed up onto beaches by flows and waves, when beachcombers can find them as gems. Each shell has a unique narrative to tell and reflects the past of the sea that it once called itself. Even after washing ashore, seashells provide essential ecological functions. They act as shelters for small animals like hermit crabs and tiny marine critters that attach themselves to the shells, as well as habitats and safety for many different species. Beyond their ecological value, seashells have long attracted mankind. They have been utilized by cultural traditions as tools, decorative things, and money. Artists are inspired by the beauty of nature, while collectors marvel at their distinctive shapes, colors, and patterns.</p>
